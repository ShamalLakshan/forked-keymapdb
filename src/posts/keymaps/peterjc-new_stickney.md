summary: "A set of Karabiner-Elements mappings to allow the New Stickney Japanese layout to be used (in conjunction with the macOS IME). The layout is supported natively on Linux with the Hiragana IME. It is intended to be more ergonomic with only three rows for the kana than the JIS standard which uses four rows."
